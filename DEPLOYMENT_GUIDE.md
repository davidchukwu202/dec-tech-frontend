# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ **Code Ready:**
- [x] All components working
- [x] Backend connected to Render
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Images optimized
- [x] TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] Build process tested

### ✅ **Files Organized:**
- [x] README.md updated
- [x] package.json configured
- [x] .gitignore properly set
- [x] Environment files ready
- [x] Scripts functional

## 🔄 GitHub Deployment Steps

### 1. **Initialize Git Repository:**
\`\`\`bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: DEC Tech Solar Website"
\`\`\`

### 2. **Create GitHub Repository:**
- Go to GitHub.com
- Create new repository: `dec-tech-website`
- Don't initialize with README (we have one)

### 3. **Push to GitHub:**
\`\`\`bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dec-tech-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
\`\`\`

## 🌐 Vercel Deployment

### 1. **Connect to Vercel:**
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Sign in with GitHub
- Click "New Project"
- Import `dec-tech-website` repository

### 2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
\`\`\`
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://dec-tech.onrender.com
\`\`\`

### 3. **Deploy:**
- Click "Deploy"
- Wait for build to complete
- Your site will be live at: `https://dec-tech-website.vercel.app`

## 🔧 Backend Verification

### Test your backend endpoints:
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:backend
\`\`\`

### Expected results:
- ✅ Basic connectivity
- ⚠️ Some APIs may not exist yet (normal)
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks working

## 📱 Post-Deployment Testing

### Test these pages:
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Products page shows items
- [ ] Calculator works
- [ ] Contact forms submit
- [ ] About page displays
- [ ] Mobile responsive

### Test backend integration:
- [ ] Products load from backend (if available)
- [ ] Contact forms submit to backend
- [ ] Graceful fallback to sample data

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### ✅ **Deployment Successful If:**
- Website loads without errors
- All pages are accessible
- Forms work (with fallback)
- Images display correctly
- Mobile responsive
- Fast loading times

### ⚠️ **Common Issues:**
- **Build errors**: Check TypeScript/ESLint
- **Image loading**: Verify image paths
- **API errors**: Backend may not have all endpoints yet
- **Environment variables**: Ensure they're set in Vercel

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected to Vercel:
- Every push to `main` branch auto-deploys
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Automatic builds and optimizations

## 📊 Monitoring

### After deployment, monitor:
- Site performance
- Error logs in Vercel dashboard
- Backend API response times
- User feedback
